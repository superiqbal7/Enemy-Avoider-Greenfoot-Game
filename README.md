# Enemy-Avoider-Greenfoot-Game
This is a game made using Greenfoot, with three types of elements: a PLAYER piece, controlled by the player; a FOOD piece that can be ‘caught’ by the player; and an ENEMY, that can ‘catch’ the player. If the enemy catches the player, then the game is over. If the player can eat all the pizza before beign attacked by enemy then player will win otherwise player will lose the game.
